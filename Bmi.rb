# def calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_m)
#   # Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
#   bmi = weight_kg / (height_m ** 2)
#
# end
#
# # Example usage:
# weight = 70 # Replace with the person's weight in kilograms
# height = 1.75 # Replace with the person's height in meters
#
# bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
# puts "BMI: #{bmi}"

# # # Now we will calculate BMI--
# # # BMI = Body Mass Index
# # # Formula -- BMI = Weight(kg)/height(meter)^2
# #
# print"Input your weight : "
# weight = gets.chomp.to_f
#
# print"Input Your Height : "
# height = gets.chomp.to_f
#
# bmi= (weight/(height*height))
#
# print "your bmi is : #{bmi}\n"
# if  bmi < 18.5
#   print "Body weight is less,you should be taken in moderation"
#
# elsif bmi >= 18.5 && bmi <= 24.9
#
#   print"Ideal standard of good health"
#
# elsif bmi >= 25  && bmi <= 29.9
#   print "Excess body weight,You need to lose excess body weight by exercising"
#
# elsif  bmi >= 30  && bmi <= 34.9
#   print "You are in the early stages of getting fat,You need to eat healthy and exercise"
#
# elsif bmi >= 35  && bmi <= 39.9
#   print "You are in the second stages of getting fat,Moderate diet and exercise are required"
#
# elsif bmi > 40
#   print"extra fat,Fear of death,Doctor's advice isÂ required"

##In Roby programming we use either print,Puts or p to display the code we write...
# 1. print   2. puts  3. p
# Now let's see their example:
#


## Now we will take value through input in if else or elif condition--
